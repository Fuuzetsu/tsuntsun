Interacts with tesseract to ease reading of RAW Japanese manga.

The usage is fairly simple. Start the program, passing it a filename
to use. Once it sees that the file has changed, it will run tesseract
over it and show its results in the text box. This is useful if you're
trying to identify some characters for translation.

The radio buttons change the modes tesseract operates in. Please read
the tesseract manpage to find out more. Vertical text is the default.

A button to run scrot is provided for easy access but you're free to
update the input file however you wish.
